# Cleveland Beer Map

## Overview

This is the final project in Udacity's FEND Nano-Degree program.
It is designed to demonstrate the skills acquired through the program.
The project uses React along with the following APIs and external dependencies:

* [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)
* [FourSquare API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)
* [React Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)


## Setup

* Clone this repo from [https://github.com/bimonson/cleveland-beer-map.git](https://github.com/bimonson/cleveland-beer-map.git)
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`

A new browser window should open automatically, displaying the app.
If not, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Use

* Cleveland area breweries and beer related venues are displayed on a Google Map and listed in a side bar
* Clicking the markers or list items will open an info window displaying the name and photo of the location
* An input field is available so the user can filter the venues visible on the list and map

## Offline Mode

The default service worker is used in this app (bootstrapped with create-react-app) and so only works in production build.
